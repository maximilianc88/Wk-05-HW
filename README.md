Build a dynamic day planner application powered by Javascript, JQuery, and Moment.JS library.
<ul>
<li>
The day planner displays the current weekday and day of the week.
</li>
<li>
Inputting items in the text forms and pressing the save buttons will save to local storage.
</li> 
<li>
The background colors of the text forms change depending on the current time of day. If the current time is past the hours in the day planner, the background colors will be grey. If the current time is before the hours in the day planner, the background colors will be green. If the current time matches the current hour on the day planner, the background color will be red.
</li> 
</ul>
